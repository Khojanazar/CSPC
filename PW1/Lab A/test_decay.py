"""
Tests for the decay simulation.

One complete test is given as a model. Add the two tests described in the
lab handout (a negative-rate test, and a test against the analytical law).
Run with:  pytest -v

def test_matches_law():
    avg=np.mean
#   Check that the simulation's AVERAGE over many seeds is close to the
#   physical law  N0 * exp(-lam * t).
#   Which pytest tool compares floating-point values with a tolerance?
